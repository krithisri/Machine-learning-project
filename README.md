## Overview

**This paper is a replication of a previous work, ’Studying the Relationship between Exception Practices and Post-release Defects’. Exceptions are one of the common events that are often seen in programming. Though the code to handle these exceptions is kept separately, often this code leads to many issues. Hence, in this paper the relationship between the quality of software in terms of post-release bugs and the exception handling metrics has been observed. The observations were performed on the open source software Apache KAFKA. After deriving the required pre-release defects, post-release defects, exception flow characteristics and exception anti-pattern metrics, models have been constructed. Depending on the results from the models, it was found that exception-flow characteristics have a remarkable relationship with post- release defects. Hence, it can be understood that the IT firms need to allocate more teams to perform those tasks to avoid any catastrophic failures in future.**
